Trussme: A library for truss analysis and design

This library includes some utilities and tools for analyzing and designing truss structures.

Examples
--------
First, let's construct a small truss
>>> import trussme
>>> small_truss = trussme.Truss()
>>> pin = small_truss.add_pinned_joint([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
>>> free = small_truss.add_free_joint([2.5, 2.5, 0.0])
>>> roller = small_truss.add_roller_joint([5.0, 0.0, 0.0])
>>> small_truss.add_member(pin, free)
>>> small_truss.add_member(pin, roller)
>>> small_truss.add_member(roller, free)

Since our truss is planar, its important to add out-of-plane support
>>> small_truss.add_out_of_plane_support("z")

Let's add a load to the truss
>>> small_truss.set_load(free, [0, -10000, 0])

Finally, let's analyze the truss and get the factor of safety and mass
>>> small_truss.analyze()
>>> round(small_truss.fos, 2)
0.96
>>> round(small_truss.mass, 2)
22.48
